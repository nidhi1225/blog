                collection, use, and disclosure of personal information on https://wealthquint.com. This privacy policy deals with

            <h2>Mediavine Programmatic Advertising (Ver 1.1)</h2>
            <p>
                The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine 
                serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is 
                a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web 
                server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website. First party cookies 
                are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and 
                analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons 
                and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with 
                advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block 
                both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers 
                will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing 
                cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult 
                the information at All About Cookies. Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and 
                features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In 
                the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.
            </p>
            The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:
            <ul>
                <li>IP Address</li>
                <li>Operating System type</li>
                <li>Operating System version</li>
                <li>Device Type</li>
                <li>Language of the website</li>
                <li>Web browser type</li>
                <li>Email (in hashed form)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end 
                user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also 
                separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data 
                collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, 
                including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information 
                about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about 
                a visitor’s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience 
                segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising. If you would like more information about this practice and to 
                know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit National Advertising Initiative opt out page. 
                You may also visit Digital Advertising Alliance website and Network Advertising Initiative website to learn more 
                information about interest-based advertising. You may download the AppChoices app at Digital Advertising Alliance’s 
                AppChoices app to opt out in connection with mobile apps, or use the platform controls on your mobile device to opt out.

                Like many websites, this website sets and uses cookies to enhance your user experience — to remember your personal settings, 
                for instance. Advertisements may display on this website and, if so, may set and access cookies on your computer; such 
                cookies are subject to the privacy policy of the parties providing the advertisement. However, the parties providing the 
                advertising do not have access to this site’s cookies. These parties usually use non-personally-identifiable or anonymous 
                codes to obtain information about your visits to this site.  For more information about this type of online advertising, 
                cookies, and how to turn this feature off, please visit this link. Please note that turning off advertising cookies won’t 
                mean that you are not served any advertising, merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.

                about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content,
